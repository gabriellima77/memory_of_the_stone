# Memory of the Stone
It's a memory game that test your memorization capabilities, using HearthStone cards.<br/>
So every time you click a card the deck shuffle and you have to click a card that you don't clicked yet.<br />
This game has 5 level and every level adds new cards. When you level up the amount of cards change, the new number will be (last level number of cards) + 4.<br />
This way the max score is 60pts.<br />
This application was build with React using function components and hooks, so this project has a pretty good use of useState and useEffect in its code.
Furthermore I use HearthStone API to fetch the cards data.
